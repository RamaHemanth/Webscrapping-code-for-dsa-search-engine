# Webscrapping-code-for-dsa-search-engine
I had uploaded only 5 text cases of problems due to limited space.
Search engine requires a dataset of 2-3k problems which can be scrapped using following python code above.
I used selenium and beautiful soap to scrapp questions their titles and links of problems seperately in their respective text files.
